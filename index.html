 <p> Cheetahs are Incredibly interesting and graceful animals on the earth. 
    These huge cats cannot boast the same strength and power as other big cats like lions and tigers, 
    but they are able to catch absolutely anyone, and it doesnâ€™t matter if he runs on spirit legs or four paws. 
    Flexible and nimble, they are forced to constantly hunt, as such an active lifestyle makes them burn a lot of calories. </p>
